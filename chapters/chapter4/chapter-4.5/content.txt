4.5 THE DO LOOP

Sometimes you want to execute the body of a loop at least
once and perform the loop test after the body is executed.
The do loop serves that purpose:

do {
    statements
} while (condition)

The body of the do loop is executed first, then the condition is
tested.

Some people call such a loop a post-test loop because the
condition is tested after completing the loop body. In contrast,
while and for loops are pre-test loops. In those loop types,
the condition is tested before entering the loop body.

A typical example for such a loop is input validation. Suppose
you ask a user to enter a value < 100. If the user didn't pay
attention and entered a larger value, you ask again, until the value
is correct. Of course, you cannot test the value until the user has entered it.
This is a perfect fit for the do loop

int value;
do {
    cout << "Enter a value < 100: ";
    cin >> value;
} while (value >= 100);
