4.2 COMPUTING AND SOCIETY: THE FIRST BUG

According to legend, the first bug was found in the Mark II, a 
huge elctromechanical computer at Harvard University. It
really was caused by a bug - a moth was trapped in a relay switch.

Actually, from the note that the operatoir lewft in the log book
next to the moth (see the photo), it appears as if the term "bug"
had already been active use at the time.

The pioneering computer scientist Maurice Wilkies wrote, 
"Somehow, at the Moore School and afterwards, one had
always assumed there would no particular difficulty in
getting programs rightg. I can remember the exact instant
in time at which it dawned on me that a great part of my future
life would be spent finding mistakes in my own programs."
