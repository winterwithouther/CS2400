4.9 SPECIAL TOPIC: REDIRECTION OF INPUT AND OUTPUT

Consider the sentinel.cpp program that computes the average value of an input sequence.
If you use such a program, then it is quite likely that you already have the values in file, and it seems
a shame that you have to type them all in again. The command line interface of your operating
system provides a way to link a file to the input of a program, as if all the characters in the file had
actually been typed by a user. If you type

sentinel < numbers.txt

The program is executed. Its input instructions no longer expect input from the keyboard. All input
commands get their input from the file numbers.txt. This process is called input redirection.

input redirection is an excellent tool for testing programs. When you develop a program and fix its
bugs, it is boring to keep entering the same input every time you run the program. Spend a few
minutes putting the inputs in a file, and use redirection.

You can also redirect output. In this program, that is not terribly useful. If you run

sentinel < numbers.txt > output.txt

the file output.txt contains the input prompts and the output, such as

Enter salaries, -1 to finish:
Average salary: 15

However, redirecting output is obviously useful for programs that produce lots of output.
You can print the file containing the output or edit it before you turn it in for grading.
