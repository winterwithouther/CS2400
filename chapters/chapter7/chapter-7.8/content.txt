7.8 SPECIAL TOPIC: CONSTANT ARRAY PAREMETERS

When a function doesn't modify an array parameter, it is considered good style to add the
const reserved word, like this:

double sum(const double values[], int size)

The const reserved word helps the reader of the code, making it clear that the function
keeps the array elements unchanged. If the implementation of the function tries to modify,
the array, the compiler issues a warning.
