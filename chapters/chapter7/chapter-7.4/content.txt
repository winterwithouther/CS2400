7.4 SPEICLA TOPIC: SORTING WITH THE C++ LIBRARY

You often want to sort the elements of an array or vector. Special Topic 7.5 shows you a
sorting algorithm that is relatively simple but not very efficient. Efficient sorting algorithms
are significantly more complex. Fortunately, The C++ libraRy provides an efficient sort
function. To srot an array with size elements, call

sort(a, a + size);

To sort a vector values, make this call:

sort(values.begin(), values.end());

To fully understand why the sort function is called in this way, you will need to know
Advanced C++ that is beyond the scope of this book. But don't hesitate to call the sort
function whenever you need to sort an array or vector.

To use the sort function, include the <algorithm> header in your program.
