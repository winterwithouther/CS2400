7.5 SPECIAL TOPIC: A SORTING ALGORITHM

A sorting algorithm rearranges the elements of a sequence so that they are stored in sorted
order. Here is a simple sorting algorithm, called selection sort. Consider sorting the
following array values: (Definition of selection sort: A sorting algorithm in which the 
smallest element is repeatedly found and removed until no elements remain.)

An obvious first step is to find the smallest element. In this case the smallest element is 5.
stored in valiues[3]. You should move the 5 to the beginning of the array. of course, there 
is already an element stored in values[0], namely 11. Therefore you cannot simply move
values[3] into values[0] without moving the 11 somewhere else. You don't yet know
where the 11 should end up, but you know for certain that it should not be in values[0]/
Simply get it out of the way by swapping it with values[3].

Repeat the process. The minimum value os the unsorted region is 11, which needs to be
swapped with the first value of the unsorted region, 17.

Now the unsorted region is only two elements long; keep to the same sucessful strategy.
The minimum element is 12. Swap it with the first value, 17:

That leaves you with an unprocessed region of length 1, but of course a region of length 1 is
always sorted. You are done.

This algorithm is simple to understand, but it is not very efficient. Computer scientists have
studied sorting algorithms extensively and discovered significantly better algorithms. The
sort function of the C++ library provides one such algorithm.
