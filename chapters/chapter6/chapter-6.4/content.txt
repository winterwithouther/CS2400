6.4 WRITING TEXT OUTPUT

You use the << operator to send strings and numbers to a
stream. To write a single character to a stream, use

out_file.put(ch);

To control how the output is formatted, you use stream
manipulators. A manipulator is a vlue that affects the behavior
of the stream. It is sent to a stream using the << operator. The
setw manipulator, which you have already used, is a typical 
example. The statement

out_file << setw(10);

does not cause any immediate output, but when the next item
is written, it is padded with sufficient spaces so that the output
spans ten characters. (If a value does not fit into the given
width, it is not truncated.)

A manipulator is like a control button on a sound mixer.
It doesn't product an output, but it affects how the output looks.

Occasionally, you need to pad number with leading zeroes, for
example to print hours and minutes as 09:01. This is achieved
with the setfill manipulator:

out_file << setfill('0') << setw(2) << hours << ":" << setw(2) << minutes << setfill('');

Now, a zero is used to pad the field. Afterward, the space is
restored as the fill character.

By default, the fill characters appear before the item:

out_file << setw(10) << 123 << endl << setw(10) << 4567;

produces 
          123
         4567

The numbers line up to the right. That alignment works well for
numbers, but not for strings. Usually, you want strings to line up
at the left. You use the left and right manipulators to set
the alightment. The following example uses left alightment for a string
and then switches back to the right alighnment for a number:

out_file << left << setw(10) << word << right << setw(10) << number;

The default floating-point format displays as many digits as are
specificed by the prevision (6 by default), switching to scientific
notation for lage and small numbers. For example,

out_file << 12.3456789 << " " << 123456789.0 << " " << 0.0000123456789;

The fixed format prints all values with the same number of digits
after the decimal point. In the fixed format, the same
numbers are displayed as 

use the fixed manipulator to select the format, and the
setprecision manipulator to change the precision
